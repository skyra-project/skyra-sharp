# Skyra Dockerfiles

This folder contains all the files required to control Docker development environments for Skyra. Most of the meat of
the content is in the `docker-compose.yml` file which has the info on which images can be build and as which containers
they would be ran. In order to easily control the docker-compose file there are powershell and bash scripts:
`ps-skyra.ps1` and `bash-skyra.sh`.

Alternatively if you have access to the .NET SDK you can also run `SkyraDocker.cs` will will in turn run the `ps-skyra.ps1` script.
